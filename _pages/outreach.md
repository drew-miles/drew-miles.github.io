I'm involved in several . I look for new and creative ways to create opportunities and reduce barriers to entry for the next generation of contributors to our community. I'm currently serving on working groups for both the Astrophysics With Equity: Surmounting Obstacles to Membership [(AWESOM)](https://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/sags/awesom.php) Science Analysis Group and the [Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO)](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/habitable-worlds-observatory/start-tag/) DEIA Community Working Group. In both groups we're working to improve the accessibility of NASA funding and programs and ensure that the future of NASA missions are inclusive to all members of the community. 

I'm also an active member on several science and technology working groups for HWO and beyond, including serving as a co-lead for the UV gratings focus group. I'm also currently a deputy secretary for the [High-energy Astrophysics Division](https://head.aas.org/) of the American Astronomical Society, and am part of the organizing committee for the HEAD's [Frontier Seminar Series](https://head.aas.org/HEAD_Frontier_Seminars), with which we aim to highlight early-career members of the community with virtual seminars. 

More locally, I value mentorship opportunities for my peers and, in particular, younger students that don't yet have a firm foothold in the broader astrophysics community. A few interesting mentorship programs with which I've been involved include Caltech's [Future Ignited](https://sfp.caltech.edu/diversity-programs/future-ignited/capp) program and Rockets for Inclusive Science Education [(RISE)](https://www.mcentaffergroup.psu.edu/science-outreach/), which is still going strong at Penn State University and beyond.
