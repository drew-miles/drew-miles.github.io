I'm currently serving on working groups for both the Astrophysics With Equity: Surmounting Obstacles to Membership [(AWESOM)](https://cor.gsfc.nasa.gov/sags/awesom.php) Science Analysis Group and the [Habitable Worlds Observatory](https://science.nasa.gov/astrophysics/programs/habitable-worlds-observatory/start-tag/) DEIA Community Working Group.
