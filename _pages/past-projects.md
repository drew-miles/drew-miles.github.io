WRX: Water Recovery X-ray Rocket
------
WRX was a suborbital rocket payload that was a successor to OGRESS (see more on OGRESS below). WRX contained a single-channel soft-X-ray grating spectrograph with an H2RG hybrid CMOS detector as its primary
instrument, and also flew a hard-X-ray lobster-eye imager developed by the Czech Technical University and Rigaku Innovative Technologies. The soft-X-ray spectrograph pointed at the northern portion of the Vela
supernova remnant, while the hard-X-ray imager simultaneously observed the pulsar at the center of the remnant. WRX launched from the Kwajalein Atoll in 2018.

HaloSat
------
HaloSat was the first NASA-funded astrophysics CubeSat, led by Phil Kaaret and the University of Iowa. HaloSat launched into orbit in 2018 and operated successfully until I worked on HaloSat for its first year after being selected, primarily on establishing the lab infrastructure
and detector testing for the instrument. See [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=(database%3Aastronomy%20OR%20database%3Aphysics)&q=title%3A%22halosat%22&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0)
for a host of papers on the HaloSat science, instrument, and operations.
