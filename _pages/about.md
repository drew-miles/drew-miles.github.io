I'm Drew Miles, a Research Assistant Professor at the California Institute of Technology. After graduating with my PhD from Penn State University in December of 2021, I joined the Space Astrophysics Laboratory at Caltech as a postdoc and became a Research Assistant Professor in 2024. You can download a relatively up-to-date copy of my CV [here](http://drew-miles.github.io/cv/) or just a list of my publications [here](http://drew-miles.github.io/publications/).

My research interests include developing technology and instruments for astronomy and, in particular, enabling observations of extended sources of UV and X-ray emission in our Universe: supernova remnants, the UV and X-ray backgrounds, and the intergalctic and circumgalactic medium (IGM/CGM). You can find more information about my active research, including some ongoing suborbital projects and exciting future missions, on the [current research page](https://drew-miles.github.io/current-research/), and an overview of some previous projects on in [past research](http://drew-miles.github.io/past-projects/). 

You can also have a look at some of the fun activities I engage in within our community on the [outreach page](http://drew-miles.github.io/outreach/),
