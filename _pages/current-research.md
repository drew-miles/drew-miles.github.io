FIREBall: The Faint Intergalactic-medium Redshifted Emission Balloon
------
FIREBall (now in an iteration known as FIREBall-2) is a suborbital balloon project that seeks to detect and map the emission from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of
low-redshift galaxies (z < 1). 

tREXS: The Rockets for Extended-source X-ray Spectroscopy
------
tREXS is a suborbital rocket project that uses a soft-X-ray grating spectrograph with a large field of view to detect and characterize emission from extended astrophysical sources.
