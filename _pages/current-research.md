FIREBall: The Faint Intergalactic-medium Redshifted Emission Balloon
------
FIREBall (now in an iteration known as FIREBall-2) is a suborbital balloon project that seeks to detect and map the emission from the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of low-redshift galaxies (z < 1). 

tREXS: The Rockets for Extended-source X-ray Spectroscopy
------
tREXS is a suborbital rocket project that uses a soft-X-ray grating spectrograph with a large field of view to detect and characterize emission from extended astrophysical sources. tREXS was initiated in 2018 and I designed the instrument as part of my PhD research. The payload launched for the [first time in 2022](https://www.nasa.gov/technology/science-instruments/high-precision-x-ray-instrument-will-make-its-first-trip-to-space/) from White Sands Missile Range and was recovered successfully. The 2022 flight was the first of what we hope will be several launches; the instrument was only at about half of its intended strength (two spectrograph channels in 2022 vs. a planned four spectrograph channels) and is not yet fully assembled into its final form. An extension of the tREXS mission was proposed to NASA for funding in the 2023 NASA APRA solicitation and, if selected, will allow for a continuation of the assembly and additional launches in 2026 and 2028.
